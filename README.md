This is my capstone project for the Udacity MLND. You can find the [proposal.pdf](proposal/proposal.pdf) and the [report.pdf](proposal/report.pdf) in this repository.


## Setup

This project was build with **Python 3.5**, on Ubuntu 16.04. Its recommended to use [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create an environment for the project.

```
conda create -n capstone python=3.5
conda activate capstone
```

Then install the required python packages with PIP:

```
pip install -f requirements.txt
```

I've used an NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU to run training faster. In this case use these file instead:

```
pip install -f requirements-gpu.txt
```


## Usage

Before running the training process
